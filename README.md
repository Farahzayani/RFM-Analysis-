# RFM Analysis 
It's a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customersâ€™:
## Recency: 
The date they made their last purchase
## Frequency!
How often they make purchases
## Monetary value:
The amount spent on purchases
==> Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
